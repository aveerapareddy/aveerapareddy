<h1>Hi There, I am <a  href="https://aveerapareddy.github.io/" target="_blank">Akhilesh Veerapareddy</a></h1>

I have been working as a Full Stack Developer for over 6 years since graduated (B.E) from Anna University, Chennai in the year 2015. And as a software developer I've racked up experience of a wide variety of application development especially in web technologies. I have failed too many times to count. And my goal is to become a **Software Architect**.
